Hi, I’m @viivi-uhari

I’m interested in user-oriented software design and development. 
I enjoy programming because it gives you the opportunity to be creative
and to solve actual problems by using logic.

I’m learning new things about Computer Science every day
that make me fascinated about the subject even more:
Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, Web Software Development, ...

My programming languages:
- Scala
- C
- Python 
- JavaScript
- HTML, CSS
- SQL
